## Toggles for continuous modes.
## Modes that aren't continuous will end the instant all antagonists are dead.
## Keep in mind that this is quite unlikely for round types where antagonists are numerous and/or less obvious.

## Toggles for allowing midround antagonists (aka mulligan antagonists).
## In modes that are continuous, if all antagonists should die then a new set of antagonists will be created.
## Which rounds can use this feature depend on these toggles. Keep in mind that toggling this for a non continous round is pointless.
