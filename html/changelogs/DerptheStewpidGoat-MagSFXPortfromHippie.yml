changes: 
  - rscadd: "Every gun that uses magazines have been given their very own sound effects which play when the magazine is loaded into or unloaded out of the gun! In addition, chambering (removing) a round from the gun with no magazine in also plays its own sound. Credits to Insurgency (standalone) and Receiver for the sounds. This feature was ported from Hippie Station 13."
  - rscadd: "Shotguns which load via a tube now also play a SFX when a shell is loaded."
