  - qol: Hypernob Protection (given to plasmamen that are breathing Hypernob as gas)
      is a status effect now and gives better feedback to the user.
  - balance: Hypernob Protection gives a small slowdown.
  Hamcha:
  - bugfix: The agent card now correctly allows you to take anyone's identity, even
      if their name contains numbers
  OrionTheFox:
  - bugfix: Chainsaws can now actually cut wood! So can the giant axe that is the
      PKC, and other chainsaw items - but, alas, esword handles alone can not, and
      you must actually turn them on. Also, all mining implements can mine scattered
      stones as well!
  - bugfix: Chainsaws are now faster when they are on, and slower when they aren't.
  Salex08:
  - bugfix: blacklists placeholder food items in the random food generator which caused
      error sprites appearing
  ShizCalev:
  - qol: Gas filtering cloth are now smaller and can fit inside boxes!
  chesse20:
  - rscadd: Furry Pride Spraypaint added to spray cans
  - rscdel: Y##f In H##l Sprapaint removed from spray cans
  jlsnow301:
  - code_imp: Refactored a large number of TGUI interfaces into TypeScript. If something's
      broken, report it!
  private-tristan:
  - bugfix: metastation library no longer has 2 air alarms
