Keep in mind that while you could for example heal with unstable mutagen, you'd still mutate. Beware of secondary effects! Drugs like antitoxin are especially dangerous to these races now since not only do they do toxin damage, but they remove other toxic chems before they can heal you. Be wary also of wide band healing drugs like omnizine.</li>

				<li class="tweak">The Break Will Script has been renamed to Dementia Doctrine, is slightly faster, and causes slightly more brain damage.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added clockwork reclaimers. Ghosts can now click on Ratvar to become clockwork reclaimers - small constructs capable of forcefully converting those that still resist Ratvar's reign. Alt-clicking a valid target will allow the reclaimer to leap onto the head of any non-servant, latching onto their head and converting the target if they are able. The target will be outfitted with an unremovable, acid-proof hat version of the reclaimer. The reclaimer will be able to speak as normal and attack its host and anything nearby. If the reclaimer's host goes unconscious or dies, it will leap free.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added pinion airlocks. These airlocks can only be opened by servants and conventional deconstruction will not work on them. They can be created by proselytizing a normal airlock or from Ratvar.</li>
