  - tweak: "Nanotrasen management has recently expanded the equipment available to miners from equipment vendors. A full list may be found below."
  - rscadd: "Explosive mining charges are now available and will provide a less labor-intensive way to break through rocks and mineral deposits. They may only be placed on rock (unless the safety is disabled)."
  - rscadd: "By compacting various meats into a ball, throwable bait is now available and will distract certain carnivorous xenobiological entities if they happen to be attacking you."
  - rscadd: "Capture spheres are the newest from BackpackMinions Inc. and will allow you to capture monsters to use in battles and for companionship. These are not currently available due to their buggy operation."
  - rscadd: "We've negotiated a deal with FreezeWare, and they've provided us with portable refrigerators which can keep hivelord cores in stasis, preventing them from becoming inert while stored."
  - rscadd: "Ore boxes have been made more sturdy. They now preserve some ore in the event of an explosion, and can be armored with goliath plating to make them immune to blasts."
  - rscadd: "Adamantine ore has been discovered. This is a very malleable metal that can be used to make synthetic armor plating, tools, and increase the digging power of drills. We are confident more uses will be found for this in the future."
  - rscadd: "Strange lights have begun to appear on the asteroid. These lights have shown signs of intelligence and appear to be malicious and hostile. They are composed of pure energy, and anything they leave behind upon death may be useful for charging energy-based machinery or tools."
