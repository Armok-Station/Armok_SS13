changes: 
  - rscdel: "The Longtimer quirk has been removed"
  - tweak: "Temporal Scarring has been reworked. Rather than drawing from one of five random slots each round, you now have 3 slots that you will go through sequentially, so if you survive a round with a bunch of scars, they'll be with you 3 rounds from now."
