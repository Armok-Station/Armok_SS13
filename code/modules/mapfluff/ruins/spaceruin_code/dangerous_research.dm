	content = list("<B>Day 003 - Code 201</B> -> Three days into the 100 day mission, Doctor Greyham and Researcher Smith got into a minor dispute over the owner of a biopsy tool. Both were seperated and reprimanded by the Head Occultist.\
	<B>Day 014 - Code 104</B> -> Another issue with Researcher Smith, who was found to be using the chem dispensers to produce low-grade stimulants. Head Occultist Valentin seemed incredibly upset at the relatively harmless drugs, and has banned all production of stimulants\
	<B>Day 034 - Code 109</B> -> Researcher Beaches apparently entered a restricted area during the off hours to check on a research sample without the Head Occultist's permission. A curfew has been installed.\
	<B>Day 047 - Code 311</B> -> Researcher Armstrong w... okay, the HO stopped watching, Elias is fucking losing it. I'm not allowed in the research labs unless there's an incident, but you can HEAR screaming from the lobby. Everyone is on edge. Jexa has been bolted into their room for protesting something, not sure.\
	<B>Day 051 - Code ???</B> -> The Head Occultist has been acting strange again, he's up at night in the lab, not eating, not sleeping. He's been giving the team these speeches about how close we are, I'm not paid enough to know what we're close to though.\
	<B>Day 052 - Ongoing Incident</B> -> Explosion from the research lab, going to check on it now. I think I hear Dreams-of-Beaches screaming.")
