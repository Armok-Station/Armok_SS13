  - unknown: Changed the way cold affects your movement speed, you now have a body
      temperature that will regulate itself unless the outside temperatures difference
      from yours is too high, in which case you will get hotter or colder. Being cold
      slows you down and makes you shiver, being too hot will cause you to pass out.
  - unknown: Wearing clothes keeps you warm, wearing a (full, helmet and suit) spacesuit
      will vastly assist you in regulating your body temperature. Wearing at least
      a jumpsuit is probably a good idea.

  GoonStation 13 Development Team:
  - unknown: The murder all monkeys objective will now only count monkeys on z1 (the
      station) when it reports how many you have to kill. The end calculation is still
      a check for live monkeys on the station, so if more monkeys are made or brought
      in your count can be wrong.

  - unknown: Atmospherics now uses a gas chamber system and has been completely remodeled.
