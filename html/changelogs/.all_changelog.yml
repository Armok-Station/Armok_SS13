You can no longer drag a corpse to make an inifinite amount of blood trails, because once the victim's blood reaches a certain threshold it no longer leaves a blood trail (and no longer lose any more blood). The threshold depends on how much damage the mob has taken. You can always avoid hurting the dragged mob by making them stand up or by buckling them to something or by putting them in a container."
