# Sects

Religious Sects are a way to convert the fun of having an active 'god' (admin) to code-mechanics so you aren't having to press adminwho.

Sects are not meant to overwrite the fun of choosing a custom god/religion, but meant to enhance it.
The idea is that Space Jesus (or whoever you worship) can be an evil bloodgod who takes the lifeforce out of people, a nature lover, or all things righteous and good. You decide!

## Favor

Favor is the currency of the sect. You do things to gain favor with the god, and you spend favor on rites. Some sects do not use favor and have special conditions for their rewards.

## Goals

### Sects should be changing how the chaplain plays.

 > For sects to sufficiently build upon what the chaplain's deity is, it needs to be visible from how the chaplain plays and what the chaplins gets from their sect that they are a certain sect. A great example of this is the burdened god, whose followers debilitate themselves to grow closer to their god. This is visible from the outset, changes how the chaplain plays, and gives their deity a personality.

### Bibles should have downsides, or be used as the downside

 > A great way to make each sect stand out is by offering unique downsides on the bible. The bibles should be following the theme of bible healing, aka healing at a price. Greedy god takes this literally by charging money per healing, but a more typical example would be the Maintenance God's bible effect adding sludge. Sludge gives buffs, but is also a drug that can be addictive and harmful. It's also okay to remove the bible healing effect as a way to balance the sect, if not a bit boring.

## Anti-Goals

### Try to avoid excessive fetch questing.

 > With the "delete an item to gain favor" part of sects it is easy to fall into the trap of making a sect about grabbing an item and then getting favor and using it on rewards. This is pretty boring for chaplains and doesn't really give their deity much of a personality. So the items should have some special circumstances around getting them (Pyre God requiring preparing a body in a specific way for the favor, or lit candles), or alternatively consider using an alternate way to gain favor (Honorbound gaining favor via recruitment)
