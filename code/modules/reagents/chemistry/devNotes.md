# Things I edited that might break or things I need to do

if you're reading this in the PR. I forgot to remove this or I'm in the middle of testing these things.

- Check the scanner thing in medical and add a invisible check
- check failed chem - seems to work
- Return fluro to instant
- Convert previous_reagents_list into a list of types, not a list of objects

- I think botany is okay too, but check a few reactions there

- remove debug messages
- test foam without instant react - check if it needs REACT_INSTANT in the reagents datum just in case
- make sure plumbing remains functional after conditions to deal with smoke and the optimisations put in

- write the readme
- make the PR!
- make fancy webms to show off effects!
- convert webms because github is dumb and wants gifs

- atomise universal indicator for ghetto chem
- atomise do like an otter, add acid to water (though will plumbing make this too much?)
- are all the pHes in? Maybe add more? (maybe ask the person reading this if they'd be willing to help suggest pHes for reagents?)
- read over diff
