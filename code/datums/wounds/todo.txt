1. Convert wound_flags to required_limb_biostate
2. Convert all wounds to further abstracted versions (/wound/burn -> /wound/burn/flesh)

3. Completely chance how the treat() chain works to make it so you can choose if a item will be used normally or not in a failure state/normal state
4. maybe add oil decals if T2/3 blunt wounds happen
