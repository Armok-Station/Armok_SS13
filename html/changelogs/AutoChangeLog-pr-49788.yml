changes:
  - bugfix: "DNA Consoles have had a firmware update. Mutations can once again be removed properly from the selection list of Advanced Injectors and chromosomes can be removed from storage in any order."
  - bugfix: "Chromosomes can now be added to all activated mutations on a test subject using the DNA Console instead of just the last activated mutation in the list."
  - bugfix: "Advanced Injectors no longer super-hyper-mega-ultra-expend themselves and will now only expend themselves once."
  - bugfix: "Genetic data from used Mutation Activators may now be too limited to extract a new chromosome at DNA Consoles."
  - bugfix: "Chromosomes now always insert themselves into DNA Consoles when created, unless the console storage buffer is full in which case the chromosome is left on top of the console."
  - tweak: "There are now additional feedback messages during the chromosome creation process to keep the user informed."
