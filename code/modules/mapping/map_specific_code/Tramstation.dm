<center><b>INSTRUCTIONAL GUIDE TO PROCESSING NEW INMATES</center>
</b> <br>

<br> To process inmates through this genpop system, please see the below described lists to proper processing procedures:
<br> 1. Swipe new prisoner ID on a genpop locker to link them together. Store the inmate's equipment in this locker.
<br> 2. Swipe your ID on the prisoner ID and assign a time for their sentencing. Attach ID to inmate.
<br> 3. Process inmate through the labeled security gate, either willingly or by force. This will activate the timer on their card and start their sentencing.
<br> 4. Once their sentence is over, their ID will allow them to pass through the gate once again and they will be able to freely collect their belongings.
<br> 5. Escort the newly ex-inmate out through the front brig doors back out into the station.
