 * Sandstorm Event: Throws dust/sand at one side of the station. High-intensity and relatively short,
 * however the incoming direction is given, along with preparation time. Damages can be reduced or
 * mitigated with a few people, but leaving the event to run on its own can lead to widespread breaches.
 *
 * Meant to be encountered mid-round, with enough spare manpower among the crew to properly respond.
 * Anyone with a welder or metal can contribute.
