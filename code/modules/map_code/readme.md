These folders should be used to store any map-specific fluff items, to reduce the number of map-side variable edits (and for organisation's sake). Subfolders are provided for stations, ruins, and away missions.

If a map is to be removed, do not mindlessly remove its associated file here, as the items defined here may not be exclusively found on only that map.
