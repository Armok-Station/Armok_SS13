  /tg/station ss13 team:
  - unknown: You are now told what your job is and are offered to change your name,
      even if you aren't AI. This implementation is kind of kludgy and will be rolled
      into a new character sheet in the future.
  - unknown: Fixed the default state of req_access_txt to make things easier for mapmakers.
  - unknown: Fixed a bug with how req_access_txt was being read
  - unknown: Removed the "THROW" icon from the AI's HUD
  - unknown: Shuttle arrival and holding times have been cleaned up to make them easier
      to modify in the future.
  - unknown: Fixed bug that would prevent rounds from ending.
  - unknown: Meteors do more damage, but no longer blind/deafen/mute you.
  - unknown: Meteors can now fly in from all directions, not just the East.
  - unknown: ACCESS LEVEL REVAMP. The old 4>2-2-0 security cards are gone and have
      been replaced with a permission-based system. That means you are given actual
      permissions such as "Access security" or "access the bridge" or "eject engine
      core". All items (computers, doors, etc.) check your security card for the required
      permission to be set. As this changes how station equipment works, it breaks
      all previous maps. There is a .txt in the root folder of the SVN detailing how
      to convert old maps. All appropriate security computers and interfaces have
      been updated for ease of use. The added benefit of this update is that adding
      new and wild permissions is now VERY easy to implement, both on the map side
      and code side.
  - unknown: Asleep and unconscious people now hear muffled voices instead of clear
      text.
  - unknown: Fixed problems that occur when two people have the same name.
  - unknown: Turning off your internals now generates a refresh (it only worked when
      you turned them on before)
  - unknown: Timer-igniter combinations now ignite things other than bombs.
  - unknown: The Camera item has been removed from the forensics locker (it was broken
      and lagged out servers anyway)
  - unknown: Left clicking on the teleporter computer now brings up the command dialogue
      (instead of having to right-click)
  - unknown: The teleporter dialogue now lists only beacons, not all things with frequencies
      (and you can only lock onto beacons)
  - unknown: The AI can now operate the teleporter (with some difficulty, particularly
      locking onto things - camera must be in follow mode)
  - unknown: Left-clicking the teleportation hub now toggles it on and off.
  - unknown: The teleportation target now follows the becaon (instead of the first
      reported beacon location)
  - unknown: Turrets now hit people lying down.
  - unknown: Turrets now shoot you in random body parts, not just the chest (which
      fixes the turrets-never-kill-you bug)
  - unknown: Turrets now have a 3 second cooldown between shots so they don't spam
      you to death in the first second
  - unknown: RWalls now produce and consume the same amount of materials when building
      or dismantling. No more free metal, kids.
  - unknown: EMags now open (and break) secure closets. Added a new icon (by Judenhauer
      and weasello) that shows FANCY SPARK EFFECTS!
  - unknown: People wearing a face-obscuring mask and wearing no ID now show up as
      "unknown"
  - unknown: Gas masks no longer count as helmets (they used to shield from head damage)
  - unknown: The nuclear disk can now be observed, so dead/admin can follow it
  - unknown: The sandbox panel now requires authentication (pubbies were spawning
      toolboxes in the start area and beating each other)
  - unknown: The sandbox panel now appears even if you spawn in mid-round
  - unknown: The "enter" verb has been removed and it's functionality has been rolled
      into "ready" (you only have to type READY to spawn in now)
  - unknown: You now spawn into the game with all the equipment associated with your
      job assignment (toolbox in hand, clothes on, etc.)
  - unknown: You no longer start mid-round naked
  - unknown: Walls are now built directly under you, making your 'facing' direction
      no longer important. To make this happen, girders are now passable tiles (you
      can walk through them).
  - unknown: \"Repair wall" is now gone, instead you use metal on the exposed girders.
  - unknown: Time to build and dismantle walls has been increased to compensate for
      the new ease of building them.
  - unknown: Traitors no longer get the "Hijack" verb (there was no legitimate use
      for it)
  - unknown: The "Eject Engine" objective no longer appears for the Traitor, and has
      been replaced with "Cut power to 80% of the station" (that figure can be easily
      adjusted in the code)
  - unknown: Added "Kill all monkeys on the station" traitor objective
  - unknown: Added "Destroy 70% of plasma containers on the station" traitor objective
      (value easily changed in code)
  - unknown: Added "Destroy AI" traitor objective
  - unknown: Fixed some traitor text to make more sense
  - unknown: The Intercept now only prints on the bridge (no longer in engineering
      or security)
  - unknown: The AI mission of "kill everyone" was actually coded as a percentage
      value. The mission now reflects the code (and defaults to 75% murder rate -
      which is higher than before)
  - unknown: Fixed the bug where it was impossible to steal a fully charged laser
      (since laser charges were reduced below the threshold)
  - unknown: Fixed issue where airlocks would attempt to close even if they were already
      closed.
  - unknown: Air tanks now start with a flow rate of 100 enabled (instead of 350),
      oxygen in the tank is now 25% of what it used to be, and jetpacks have half
      of THAT.
  - unknown: Tasers have 4 charges instead of 8.
  - unknown: Game Kit is now fixed (chessboard)
  - unknown: Stacking large piles is fixed (previously clicking a pile of 50 on another
      pile of 50 created one pile of 5 and another of 95. They now both stay at 50)
  - unknown: 'Radio communications methods have changed. You would now use: "say "/words
      words"" instead of: "say "\[h]words words". All other commands, such as \[r],
      \[1], etc. have been replaced with :r and :1, etc.'
  - unknown: Unauthenticated users can no longer vote.
  - unknown: There is now an indicator if the person you are observing is dead.
  - unknown: Rearranged the order of suffixes in the observe code.
  - unknown: Regular batons are now replaced with stun batons. They look cooler, do
      more damage, and stun people for 10-60 seconds with each hit. They can still
      talk while stunned.
  - unknown: The throwing system has been completely replaced. Now you can click throw,
      then click on the square you want to try to throw to. Your facing direction
      no longer has any effect.
  - unknown: Throwing items no longer alters your direction of travel. If you slip
      into space, throwing your shoes will move you one square backwards but you will
      continue to float in the direction you slipped.
  - unknown: Mass drivers can now drive anything, and they can (With some trivial
      code changes) even drive diagonally.
  - unknown: Only spacesuits protect you from the vacuum of space. Firesuits and biohazard
      suits will now send you to the morgue.
  - unknown: Suicide verb fixed so you can use it in the spawn area (in case you want
      to observe), you can no longer suicide if you are dead (duh), and you can attempt
      suicide once every 20 seconds now (in case some jerk doctor is healing you or
      you are monkeyed back to life).
  - unknown: Attacking people at spawn should now be disabled. You might be able to
      hit people with ID cards but they do zero damage. Admin spawned weapons still
      hurt.
  - unknown: Personal lockers now have smarter stacking (headsets and backpacks on
      the top)
  - unknown: False walls now work properly whether you are holding a tool or not (it
      doesn't auto-open if you are holding a tool)
  - unknown: False wall display bug fixed
  - unknown: A lot of code cleaning was done, making things niiice and pretty.

  - unknown: Fixed bug where emags weren't working properly on doors
  - unknown: Made doors not openable before the round starts
  - unknown: emags now have a higher priority, so if you have access to a locker the
      emag will still fry it
  - unknown: Fixed windoor and airlock display where running into it multiple times
      would restart the animation
  - unknown: Secured closets are no longer anchorable (you can push them now)

  - unknown: Walking through girders is no longer allowed; you still build them directly
      under you though so watch out which way you step off.
  - unknown: Hitting an AI computer with an item caused an exception error. It now
      behaves in a sane fashion (only checks for modules).
  - unknown: Communications intercepts now print in any location (previous patch made
      it only print in the 'bridge' area)

2008-06-24:
  /tg/station ss13 team:
  - unknown: 'Server crash where a non-player-human died has been resolved (ie: monkeys-turned-humans

      long sonnets)
  - unknown: Emptying Pockets before game start caused a server error; no longer the
      case
  - unknown: The FLOWRATE global constant has been changed to 0.99. This should speed
      up gaseous flow in pipes (and therefore make the engine run smoother) but may
      have big unforseen consequences. Keep eyes open for bugs.
  - unknown: Fixed engine z-level definition preventing it from ejecting
  - unknown: Access_Medical_Records permission has been set appropriately (nobody
      could do it before)
  - unknown: There are now 3 atmos techs and 3 station techs instead of 5 and 1

      out (instead of just being an insta-kill)
  - unknown: Added beer to the game, complete with HARM and HURT effects (when clicking
      on both yourself and others). It'll need some tweaking in the damage-dishing
      department before it becomes a common fixture on maps (it's a bit too powerful
      right now)
  - unknown: Admins can now manually authorize pubbies to enter the game (and to make
      them monkeys)
  - unknown: The traitor's radio is now hidden inside a normal radio device, so that
      you cannot figure out who the traitor is just by looking at his inventory.
  - unknown: Camera view now allows you to read papers one square away (AI and security
      terminals)
  - unknown: Camera view can papers more than one square away in a garbled state (similar
      to monkey reading)
  - unknown: Camera view can not see papers in people's hands, however, people can
      now hold papers up to the cameras (by clicking on them) which pops up a window
      on the AI's screen
  - unknown: Camera views are now cancelled when the camera is cut (it used to stay
      on until you switched)

  - unknown: Fixed a bug that threw errors server side when playing with your belt
  - unknown: New area type - "AI Monitored" - with accompanying new "Motion Detection"
      camera. This will throw a warning to the AI player if anybody enters (currently
      in use in EVA storage)

  - unknown: You can now wirecut atmos alert panels
  - unknown: Fixed a bug with AI cameras
  - unknown: Chaplain job fixes
  - unknown: APCs now have customizable cell capacities in the mapmaker(this will
      break old map power grids but is an easy fix)
  - unknown: APCs now have 3 "power draw" attributes in the mapmaker that allows you
      to artificially pump up the rooms power consumption
  - unknown: Added the most recent map changes to the SVN.

  /tg/station ss13 team:
  - unknown: Fixed up a bug while moving and pulling items
  - unknown: Fixed typo in airlock code
  - unknown: Added power-drain variables to APCs in the mapmaker. This lets the mapmaker
      cause artificial power drain in each room.
  - unknown: PowerCells are now of custom-capacity (set in mapmaker)
  - unknown: PowerCells with storage greater than 2500 units now count as high capacity
      (was 1000)
  - unknown: Because of the above changes, removed the artificial "powersink" object
      from the game
  - unknown: Fixed exception error thrown when cameras stop existing
  - unknown: The AI camera no longer resets when using computers
