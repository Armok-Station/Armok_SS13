//Stick some #include s here for normally uncompiled code stored in this folder that should be run only during april fools day.
//You can #define APRIL_FOOLS_MODE in _compile_options.dm
//Every March review these files. Remove the ones that no longer work if people don't intend to update them.
//Also remove the ones that just weren't funny last year. :honkman:

//REMEMBER: One really bad and overbearing april fools day gimmick can spoil the whole experience. DON'T MEME TOO HARD!!!
