changes:
  - tweak: The object verbs Rotate, Flip, and such have been replaced with a new system. Drag the object towards a cardinal direction to set it, and, if the object is flippable, drag it to the same direction as its current one to flip it. Affected objects: doppler array, disposals pipe, transit tubes, chairs, windows, windoors, emitters and PA parts. Atmos pipes are NOT affected by this change at the moment.
