PLEASE NOTE:
Major changes have been made to medbot.dm, Sleeper.dm, borghydro.dm and several reagent code files (code/modules/reagents), and will most likely continue to be made.
Several other code files not listed may have edits from the revert including premade medicines, vendors, mapping and medkits.
These changes were made primarily to revert cobbychem.
Changes in these files are mostly unmarked, do not update to tgstation upstream versions of these files without consulting Terra first.
Honestly, why does /tg/ have to make shitty changes that are hard to revert and maintain?
