HOW TO MAKE A CONSISTENT AND EASILY EDITED WORD REPLACEMENT FILE FOR A LANGUAGE

1) Create a file in /tgstation/strings named language_replacement.json, where language is the name of the language (French, Turkish, Albanian)
2) Open said file in the editor of your choice
3) Begin the file with { and end the file with }. JSON is a finicky filetype and will tolerate 1 and only 1 root object per file.
4) On the next line, tab indent and type "language": {
5) This is now the root object of your JSON; on each line thereafter, use the format "word": "replaced word", and then a line break. When called by say modification, the string "word" in say input will be replaced by "replaced word" in the say output.
6) To add multiple options for a word to be replaced by use the format "word": ["replacement1", "replacement2", ..."replacementN"], 
7) Alphabetize your wordlist to make it easy to edit (adding pronouns and articles if you are replacing many of those is preferable, otherwise just stick to alphabetical)
8) Close your root object with } and save
9) Check the file by copying all and pasting in a JSON formatter of your choice ( https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/ is a useful one) and make sure that it is a valid filetype. Travis will choke on it otherwise.
10) Get yelled at for spelling mistakes
11) You now have a working word replacement file!
