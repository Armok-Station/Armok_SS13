# Making new virtual domains

## From scratch

1. Copy and paste the TEMPLATE file.
2. Build your new map, but do not interfere with the noop areas and turfs (edges, safe house).
3. Provide a way for players to your new map via the north door, which is 4th tile over. 


## From an existing map

1. Clean your existing map's corners before pasting it. There should be no passthrough turfs nor areas.
2. Copy and paste the TEMPLATE file.
3. Copy and paste your existing map into the new template.
4. When pasting, ensure players have access via the north door.

### Notes

You can use the template map's indestructible binary filler if you wish, but this is not required. Maps can feel more open if you don't. 

Adding some open tile padding around the homebase is a good touch. About 7 tiles West/East for the visual effect of a larger map.

If you want to add prep gear, you can do so within the safehouse's noop area as long you don't alter the area or turf. The top left corner is a good spot for this, with respect for the walls, therefore [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]

Boss zones should give players pretty ample space, I've been using a 23x23 minimum area.
