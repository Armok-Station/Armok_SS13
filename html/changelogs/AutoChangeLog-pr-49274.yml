  - rscadd: "A new gamemode is hitting the station, Families."
  - rscadd: "In this gamemode, 3 different crime families will be spawned on board the station. At the 2 minute mark, it will be announced, and a 1 hour timer will start."
  - rscadd: "During this hour, all 3 crime families need to work to gain as many Points as possible, and beat out the other families."
  - rscadd: "The crime families each have a unique objective tailored to their theme. They will need to complete these objectives in order to qualify for the final win conditions."
  - rscadd: "Joining a family is 100% voluntary. There's no forced conversion. To join a family, simply ask a gangster to induct you to the family"
  - rscadd: "Points can be gained by tagging turf, holding turf, wearing your colors, convincing civilians or rival gangsters to join up or just wear the colors, rolling around in a crew, and other various methods of criminal activity!"
  - rscadd: "At the end of the hour, the Space Cops arrive! Ranging from some beat cops to the space military, these folks will be weaker or stronger based on how deadly the gangs were in the round!"
  - rscadd: "You can see how powerful the space cops will be by checking the station's Notoriety level with the handy UI element in the top right of the screen.
experimental: This gamemode will require 30 players."
