##Include modification files like this
#MODIFICATION_FILE research/techweb_modifications.txt

##If you want to fully replace hardcoded techweb nodes, use this format. The file must have an encoded JSON-list with the format of list(node.id = encoded_json_of_node). See techwebs.modification.txt for how node encoding works. This is able to be generated by SSresearch's json_export_nodes() proc.
#REPLACE_TECHWEB_NODES research/example_techweb_nodes.json

##Like above, but doing this will instead take the nodes from the file and add them, overwriting existing ones in case of conflict. Additional feature: If a node ID is associated with "DELETE" instead of a data list, it will be deleted if it exists.
#OVERWRITE_TECHWEB_NODES research/example_techweb_nodes.json
