	The colder months are finally hitting, some of the machinery seems to be having trouble starting up sometimes. Central sent some portable heaters to help keep the airlocks from
	freezing shut along with a couple storage crates with supplies. Nothing on the radio so far, what the hell do they even expect to hear down here, anyway?<br><br><b>September 15th</b>
	<br>Another supply shipment through the gateway, they've sent some heavier sets of clothes for the coming winter months. Central said they might encounter issues with shipments
	during December to Feburary, so we should try to be frugal with the next shipment.<br><br><b>November 20th</b><br>Final shipment from Central for the next few months. Going outside
	for more than 10-15 minutes without losing feeling in your fingers is difficult. We've finally gotten a signal on the radio, it's mostly some weird static though. One of the researchers is trying to decypher it.
	<br><br><b>December 10th</b><br>Signal has gotten much stronger, it almost seems like it's coming from under us according to what the researcher managed to decypher. We're waiting from the go from Central before investigating.<br><br>
