This can be imported into Notepad++ as a user language,
to decorate .dm files like they are decorated in DreamMaker.

You can also compile a dme you are currently viewing in notepad++ 
by saving the following Run command:
	CMD /K "%PROGRAMFILES%\BYOND\bin\dm.exe" $(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)

Hopefully one day we'll just be able to use notepad++ instead of the
dreammaker IDE

Have fun
