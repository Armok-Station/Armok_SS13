changes: 
  - tweak: "The convert rune has been changed. Instead of a hardcoded 3-person convert, it can use different cultist amounts. One cultist can convert someone in 60 seconds, two in 30 seconds, and three cultists is unchanged."
  - tweak: "Upon round start, there will be fewer cultists to balance out the ability to convert people alone."
