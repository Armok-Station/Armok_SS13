--- 1: Card & Game Basics ---

1.1: To start a game you need two players.

1.2: Each player needs a deck of cards to play.
	1.2.1: Decks must include 40 total cards. 
	1.2.2: You can run up to 4 copies of a specific card in your deck.
	1.2.3: All cards in your deck must be a legal TGC card.
	1.2.4: The following rules are deckbuildign rules for the tournament standard of TGC and may be ignored freely.
		1.2.4.1: When building your deck choose 3 card subtypes. Every card in your deck must have at least one of these subtypes.
		1.2.4.2: Every card in your deck must be legal, not banned and not be misprint.

1.3: A coin toss is done to decide who goes first.
	1.3.1: The coin toss decides who goes first, not who decides to go first.
	1.3.x: This means a player is decided to be heads and the other tails; whichever side the coin lands on goes first.

1.4: Each player draws 5 cards from their deck. 
1.5: Then, each player may mulligan cards in their hand.
	1.5.1 During the mulligan each player may discard a card (face-down) from their hand to draw 1.
		1.5.1.x: The opponent is not allowed to see the discarded cards but can know how many cards you chose to discard.
	1.5.2: They can perform this up to 3 times.
	1.5.3: After both players have finished mulliganing shuffle all discarded cards back into the deck.

1.6: Both players starts with 20 Heathshards (or HS) and 1 Mana.
1.7: The game begins on the Draw Phase of the player who won the coin toss.
1.8: The player that plays second keeps the coin and places it besides them, flipped on heads.
	1.9.x: This is relevant for the "Flip Coin" action, detailed in 3.6

1.9: Turns in this game are divided in 5 parts, called the phases.
	1.9.a: Draw Phase
	1.9.b: Standby Phase
	1.9.c: Play Phase
	1.9.d: Battle Phase
	1.9.e: End Phase
		1.9.x: There is no "Play Phase 2". You do not get to return to a Play Phase after the Battle Phase.

1.10: During the Draw Phase a number of automatic game actions happen, in the following order.
	1.10.1: The turn player's mana gets set to the amount of Draw Phases they have had in total, including this one.
		1.10.1.x: So on their first turn they get 1 mana, on their second 2 mana, on their third 3 mana, etc.
	1.10.2: The turn player draws a card.
	1.10.3: The turn player untaps all their tapped cards.
	1.10.4: The "Pass Phase" action is immediately performed.
	1.10.5: This Pass Phase does not create an Open gamestate and automatically happens.


1.11: Terminology definitions:
	1.11.a: When you draw a card you add the top card of your deck to your hand.
	1.11.b: When a card is destroyed it is moved to the discard pile
		1.11.b.1: When a card is destroyed all cards attached to it also get destroyed.
	1.11.c: When a card is tapped it is flipped sideways
	1.11.d: When a card is untapped it is returned to the upright position

1.12: Any player that have their HP reduced to, set to or at 0 loses the game automatically.
	1.12.1: When this happens the other player immediately wins the game.
	1.12.x: This can happen even if the game is in a Closed Gamestate

--- Open and Closed States ---

2:  The gamestate can either be Open or Closed. 

2.1: In a Closed gamestate no players may take any actions with the sole exception of:
	2.1.a: Surrendering
	2.1.b: When resolving an activated ffect that, as a part of its effect, allows its user to make a choice

2.2: In an Open gamestate then one of the players may take actions, depending on the type of Open gamestate, the phase and game information.

2.3: There are three types of Open gamestates: Open Play Gamestate, Open Battle Gamestate and the Open Quick Gamestate
	2.3.x: These can be refered to as Open Play, Open Battle and Open Quick.

2.4: During the gamestates the turn player may perform actions based on the gamestate.
	2.4.1: During the Open Play gamestate you can:
		2.4.1.a: Play A Card
			X.4.1.a.x: This can be any type of card.
		2.4.1.b: Activate An Effect 
		2.4.1.c: Pass Phase
		2.4.1.d: Flip Coin
	2.4.2: During the Battle Play gamestate you can:
		2.4.2.a: Play A Card
			X.4.2.a.x: This must be an Instant card.
		2.4.2.b: Activate An Effect 
			X.4.2.b.a: This must be a Quick effect or one that specifically can or must do so in the Battle Phase.

		2.4.3.c: Do Nothing

2.5: Different phases have diferente gamestates they default to.
	2.5.1: The only exception is the Draw Phase which does not have any Open gamestates and **always** is Closed. No Open Quick gamestates may happen here.
	2.5.2: When the gamestate "defaults" it means the gamestate is changed from its current gamestate to a new gamestate. Which new gamestate gets made depends on 		the current phase.
		2.5.2.x: This is called "defaulting", "the gamestate defaulting" or similar variations.
	2.3.3: Once a gamestate defaults the player that can play in that gamestate is the turn player.
		2.3.x: The non turn player can only play effects after the turn player used the "Pass Phase" action.
	2.5.4: The phases' default gamestates are:
		2.5.3.a: Standby Phase - Open Quick Gamestate
		2.5.3.b: Play Phase - Open Play Gamestate
		2.5.3.c: Battle Phase - Open Battle Gamestate
		2.5.3.d: End Phase - Open Quick Gamestate

--- 3: Actions to Perform ---
