 * ## AOE spells
 *
 * A spell that iterates over atoms nearby the caster and casts a spell on them.
 * By default, cast_on_thing_in_aoe is cast on ALL ATOMS in the radius of the spell (sans caster).
 *
 * However, by overriding is_affected_by_aoe,
 * you can allow the spell to only target turfs, or mobs, or doors, or whatever.
 * Or, by overriding get_things_to_cast_on,
 * you can only pass in the atoms you want to cast the spell on. Your choice.
