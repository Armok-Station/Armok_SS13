changes: 
  - rscadd: "Cigarette packets now have coupons on the back for small cargo items! Smoking DOES pay!"
  - tweak: "Single/small items in cargo have been rebranded as goodies, come in lockboxes rather than crates, and can only be purchased with private accounts. They also are immune to the 10% private account fee, obviously."
