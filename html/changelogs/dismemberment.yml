# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - rscadd: "Fukken DISMEMBERMENT! Credits for the organsystem that was adapted to our codebase go to Ricotez."
  - rscadd: "Melee and ranged weapons can dismember and behead. Dismemberment leaves behind a stump that won't heal without surgery and bleeds very bad. Some weapons such as eswords cauterize the wound as it's made, preventing bleeding."
  - rscadd: "You can also amputate limbs surgically, including stumps left behind dismemberment. You can also transplant limbs to patients; this is also how cybernetic limb augmentation is now done. Chests and heads may be augmented without removal."
  - tweak:  "You can now only have one chest and one brain cybernetic implant. Cybernetic implants are installed with organ manipulation. Eye cybernetics replace your organic eye."
  - wip: 	"Aliens and monkeys also have new organsystems, but they don't have locational damage or dismemberment yet."
