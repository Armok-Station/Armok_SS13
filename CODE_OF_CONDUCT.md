# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we might from time to time delete comments as we feel like it and can be bothered

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Writing good code

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Making bad code
* Doing things the maintainers don't like due to their personal bias

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and might occasionally take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior if they can be bothered

Project maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem annoying.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at #coderbus. We might take you seriously or we might just laugh at you.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith probably won't get punished at all
