changes: 
  - rscadd: "You can now grab your own bleeding limbs to slow your bloodloss! Target your bleeding limb and click on yourself with grab intent and an open hand. This won't speed the clotting, but you'll lose blood more slowly."
  - rscadd: "You can now juice/grind banana peels to act as makeshift coagulant. hahaha ewwwwww"
  - bugfix: "Most wound treatments (besides manipulating dislocated limbs) now respect thick clothing, so you can no longer suture through space suits."
  - tweak: "Scars are a bit less noticeable, and it takes twice as much scar severity to reach a state of \"absolutely fucked up\" when examined. They're also a bit more varied in description."
  - bugfix: "Whetstones now make things sharp edged instead of pointy edged, so they'll now deal slashing wounds instead of piercing (which means sharpening a cleaver or knife won't make it suddenly suck at hacking people apart). They also increase wounding power!"
  - bugfix: "Romerol zombies can now be wounded properly"
  - bugfix: "Using sutures to treat slashes and pierces now correctly consumes the sutures. You can also no longer use unopened regen mesh for treating wounds."
  - bugfix: "You can no longer repeatedly disembowel people who have already lost their guts."
