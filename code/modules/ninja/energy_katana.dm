/**
 * # Energy Katana
 *
 * The space ninja's katana.
 *
 * The katana that only space ninja spawns with.  Comes with 30 force and throwforce, along with a signature special jaunting system.
 * Upon clicking on a tile when right clicking, the user will teleport to that tile, assuming their target was not dense.
 * The katana has 3 dashes stored at maximum, and upon using the dash, it will return 20 seconds after it was used.
 * It also has a special feature where if it is tossed at a space ninja who owns it (determined by the ninja suit), the ninja will catch the katana instead of being hit by it.
 *
