# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open environment, we might from time to time delete comments as we feel like it and can be bothered.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Writing good code
* Not arguing with maintainers

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Doing things the maintainers don't like due to their personal bias
* Expressing support, in any shape or form, for any of the following Triggers: 
	* Space indentation
	* Pep 8
	* Mongo DB
	* Webscale

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and might occasionally take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior if they can be bothered.

Project maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem annoying.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct might apply wherever a maintainer sees you doing bad stuff.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, triggering, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at #coderbus. We might take you seriously or we might just laugh at you.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith will be fired. Out of a cannon. In to the sun.
