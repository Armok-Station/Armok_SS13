				<li class="balance">Blood spray can now move through walls and goes further, this was pretty easily cheesed because it couldn't move through walls with just hugging the edges of walls and just made him too hard to balance.</li>
				<li class="balance">Bubblegum now procs melee checks much more often, though he has the same cooldown for his melee attacks. This means you're much less likely to stand next to him and not get hit.</li>
				<li class="balance">Bubblegum now charges 2 tiles past you, makes it slightly more difficult to predict where he's going to go and makes it so he can catch up to you easier.</li>
				<li class="balance">Bubblegum now moves faster during his charge.</li>
