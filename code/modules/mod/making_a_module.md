## Introduction

This is a guide to creating a module of your own. It shows you the basics of any module creation so people who don't know anything about the system can hop on.

## Object Definition

We're simply starting out with the definition of our module. Think of what it'll do, name it, give it a desc explaining it.

```dm
/obj/item/mod/module
	name = "cow"
	desc = "Known for their milk, just don't tip them over."
```
