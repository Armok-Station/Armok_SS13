changes: 
  - rscadd: "Adds stingbangs to cargo (and one in the sec vendor premium), premium less-lethal grenades that shoot off a giant swarm of stingball pellets to help incapacitate swarms of people in tight quarters. You can jump on top of a live one to be a hero and absorb a bunch of shrapnel, same with  frag grenades. There's even an achievement for dying to a grenade you jumped on!"
  - rscadd: "Projectiles can now embed in people! Or at least grenade shrapnel and the new .38 DumDum ammo, now available in cargo, can. DumDum rounds excel against unarmored targets, but are pricey and do poorly against armored targets."
  - rscadd: "Bullets can now ricochet! Or at least, standard .38 and the new .38/L6 Match Grade ammo can. Match Grade ammo is finely tuned to ricochet easier and seek targets off bounces better, and can be purchased from cargo (for the .38) or nuke ops uplink (for the L6), but standard .38 ammo has a chance to ricochet as well."
  - tweak: "Frag grenades now have smaller explosions but shoot off a bunch of devastating shrapnel, excellent for soft targets!"
  - tweak: "Shotguns and other multi-pellet guns now print aggregate messages, so you'll get one \"You've been hit by 6 buckshot pellets!\" rather than 6 \"You've been hit by the buckshot pellet in the X!\" messages. Bye bye lag!"
  - balance: "Armor can now protect against embedding weapons, taking the best of either the bullet or bomb armor for the limb in question away from the embed chance. Some weapons are better at piercing armor than others!"
