changes: 
  - tweak: "Execution and gunpoint shots now increase the wounding power of the shot as well as the damage, and apply their bonuses to each pellet fired rather than just one"
  - tweak: "Piercing wounds make further wounds slightly easier to deal"
  - balance: "Hellguns now cost 2250 credits instead of 2000"
  - bugfix: "You can no longer punch yourself while holding someone up to trigger the charged shot"
  - bugfix: "You can no longer purposely fail executions or gunpoints to spike the damage in a loaded round for later"
