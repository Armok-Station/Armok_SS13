/**
 * # Wumborian Fugu
 *
 * A strange alien creature capable of increasing its mass when threatened, giving it unmatched defensive capabilities with decent offensive capabilities.
 *
 * A mining mob currently unavailable outside of xenobiology, the wumborian fugu grows in size to take on attackers, an ability which renders it immune to all damage while it is in effect.
 * It will eventually deflate after growing, however, opening it up to attack while its power is on cooldown.  Killing the fugu grants access to its gland, which can be used to supersize most simplemobs
 * and give them a sizeable buff.
