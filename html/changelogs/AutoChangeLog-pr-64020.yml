changes: 
  - balance: "Rubbershot is now much more bouncy than before, loses damage over range a bit slower, and has a somewhat tighter spread. Its pellets now also fly 50% slower."
  - bugfix: "Bullets that deal both brute and stamina damage like .38 Rubber will now properly have both their brute and stamina damage reduced after each ricochet, instead of just the brute."
