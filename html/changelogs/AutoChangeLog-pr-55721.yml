changes: 
  - refactor: "Job specific benefits around food and drink have been moved
into the liver. For example, a security officer starts with a liver
that gains more of a benefit from donuts and Quad Sec. Steal that liver,
and digest donuts like a cop!"
  - rscadd: "Medical Doctors, the CMO and the chaplain have a new skillchip, allowing them
to infer a person's career choice from examining their liver.
Observers also have access to this knowledge."
  - rscadd: "Livers from clowns, clownops and bananium golems now honk when squeezed."
  - bugfix: "Fixed an oversight where clownops couldn't see each other as syndicate agents."
  - bugfix: "Fixed the clown operative leader not having the same traits as other clownops."
