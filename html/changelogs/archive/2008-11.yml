  GoonStation 13 Development Team:
  - unknown: Modified shock method to work with new burn model.
  - unknown: Amount of damage from shocks now based on available power and a random
      chance.
  - unknown: Fixed typo in false walls that made an int have "" which resulted in
      a bad comparison.
  - unknown: Righteously beating someone after they're dead will update their damageicon
      AND actually do damage to them.
  - unknown: Due to the above, this means really absurd damage values can be achieved
      from beating people, if enough damage is applied to both the head and the body
      as a whole, the beaten will become unrecognizable.
  - unknown: Added get_damage proc for organs.
  - unknown: Superpill now heals organ damage in humans.
  - unknown: Game now reattempts to spawn you every 30 seconds if the arrival shuttle
      is destroyed. (This let's people rebuild it, letting you spawn.)
  - unknown: If the powergrid has large amounts (> 750,000) of power shocks will do
      an appropriately large amount of damage. This enables electric defense grids
      of a sort.
  - unknown: Spacesuits and firesuits slow you down a little bit.
2008-11-08:
  GoonStation 13 Development Team:
  - unknown: Further adjusted burn damage. Individual organs have a max damage, burn
      damage will divide it's damage among all affected organs, once one organ reaches
      it's max damage, the damage will be moved to the other organs, resulting in
      a 100% delicious corpse if it sits in fire long enough.
  - unknown: Added message when you start taking lung damage.
  - unknown: Head of Personnel can no longer get to the captain's spare ID.
  - unknown: Cryocell now shows individual organ damage for humans.
  - unknown: New sprite for main teleporter and portals.
  - unknown: Small portal now turns red on malfunction again.
2008-11-27:
  GoonStation 13 Development Team:
  - unknown: Added rapid close podlocks.
  - unknown: Cold temperatures now make you shiver and move slower.
  - unknown: You can tell if someone is taking lung damage by listening for gasps.
