changes: 
  - expansion: "Raw Prophets now have a funny little attack animation."
  - balance: "Raw Prophets have been adjusted slightly. They now have more max health, a slightly lower sight range (but the ability to toggle it on or off), drop all their component parts on death, and do more damage for every consecutive attack on a target they do."
