  - tweak: "Licking wounds on other people will automatically contract any diseases they're carrying. This is a one way transmission vector, you cannot contract disease from a felinid doctor in this way due to the partially antiseptic nature of cat saliva or whatever"
  - tweak: "You also cannot lick wounds if your mouth is covered or if you do not, in fact, possess a tongue"
