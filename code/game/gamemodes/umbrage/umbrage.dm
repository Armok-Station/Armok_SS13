/*

Umbrage is the revamped Shadowling.
The gamemode focuses around several powerful aliens, called umbrages, that attempt to enslave crew members.
The umbrages thrive in darkness and can see in it, but the light physically hurts them.
They start disguised with no special abilities, and have to spend time "hatching", during which they are vulnerable.

Every umbrage on the station shares a goal: "ascend" into a progenitor, their true form.
Resembling eldritch monstrosities, progenitors are immensely powerful, immune to most damage and capable of killing with a mere thought.
When an umbrage successfully ascends, the shuttle is called. This is their win condition.
In order to do this, they must accumulate a certain amount of veils based on round population.
Ascension itself takes a long time, and the umbrage is completely vulnerable. Their veils must protect them.
To obtain this, umbrages and their veils are linked through silent hive mind. This can be detected with the right machinery.

Fluff-wise, umbrages are much more deceptive than shadowlings, and less brute-force. They think themselves more refined than humans rather than simply superior.
Think of how we look on apes, for instance. Similar to us, and what we came from, but stupid and slow compared to us.
They believe themselves as using magic, but it's more mundane; their bodies are capable of the things they believe are magic.

Terminology you might remember has been changed to spookier variants, such as:
	shadowlings => umbrages (pronounced "um-bridge")
	thralls => veils
	ascendants => progenitors
