# Making new virtual domains

## From scratch

1. Copy and paste the TEMPLATE file.
2. Rename it to whatever you wish.
3. Build your new map, but do not interfere with the noop areas and turfs (edges, safe house).
4. Provide a way for players to your new map via the north door, which is 4th tile over. 
5. Replace any amount of the binary zone with noop turfs and areas, leaving a solid wall at the edge.

## From an existing map

1. Copy and paste the TEMPLATE file. 
2. Rename the template to whatever you wish.
3. Copy and paste your existing map onto the new template.
4. When pasting, ensure players have access via the north door.
5. Replace any amount of the binary zone with noop turfs and areas, leaving a solid wall at the edge.

### Notes

You shouldn't need to fully enclose your map in 15 tiles of binary filler. Using one solid wall should do the trick.

Adding some open tile padding around the homebase is a good touch. About 7 tiles West/East for the visual effect of a larger map.

If you want to add prep gear, you can do so within the safehouse's noop area as long you don't alter the area or turf. The top left corner is a good spot for this, with respect for the walls, therefore [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]

You can also create safehouses if you find yourself needing the same gear over and over again. There is a readme for that as well.

Boss zones should give players pretty ample space, I've been using a 23x23 minimum area.
