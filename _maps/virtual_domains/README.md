# Making new virtual domains

## From scratch

1. Copy and paste the TEMPLATE file.
2. Build your new map, but do not interfere with the noop areas and turfs (edges, safe house).
3. Provide a way for players to your new map via the north door, which is 4th tile over. 


## From an existing map

1. Clean your existing map's corners. There should be no noops, turfs or unreachable areas.
2. Copy and paste the TEMPLATE file.
3. Copy and paste your existing map into the new template.

### Notes

You can use the template map's indestructible binary filler if you wish, but this is not required. Maps can feel more open if you don't.
